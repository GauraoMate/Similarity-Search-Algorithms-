## Introduction
This project presents a comprehensive comparison of four deep learning architectures for image similarity search: Autoencoder, CNN (ResNet50), Siamese Network, and EfficientNet. Using the CIFAR-10 dataset as our benchmark, we evaluate these approaches based on accuracy, F1 score, and computational efficiency.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Autoencoder Architecture
Our autoencoder implementation follows:
- Convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction
- Batch normalization for training stability
- A bottleneck layer of 512 dimensions
- Symmetric decoder structure

Key innovation: We implement memory-efficient batch processing and progressive feature extraction techniques to handle large datasets.

### 2. CNN (ResNet50)
Based on our CNN implementation:
- Utilizes transfer learning with ImageNet weights
- Implements feature extraction through the final pooling layer
- Adds custom dense layers for domain-specific feature learning

### 3. Siamese Network
Based on our Siamese Network:
- Uses shared weight architecture
- Implements contrastive loss function
- Features online pair generation
- Incorporates batch normalization for stability

### 4. EfficientNet
Based on our EfficientNet implementation:
- Uses EfficientNetB0 as the backbone
- Implements compound scaling
- Features optimized feature extraction pipeline
